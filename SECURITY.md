# Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security issue in iVuer.js MVC FrameWork, please report it by sending an
email to [aciforcharles@gmail.com](aciforcharles@gmail.com).

This will help us to assess the risk, and make a fix available before we add a
bug report to the GitHub repository.

Thanks for helping make iVuer.js safe for everyone.
